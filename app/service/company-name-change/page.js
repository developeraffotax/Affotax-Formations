                    You can change the name of your limited company at any time after incorporation. This can usually be done within 3 working days, subject to Companies House workload. 1st Formations provides a professional service to change your company name. <br/> We will prepare and file the NM01 form at Companies House, and also provide all related documents such as a resolution, minutes, and certificate of name change. The cost of our Company Name Change Service is £69.99 plus VAT.

                    <li className="mb-1">We will file the request for a company name change electronically, and the name change should be approved within 1-2 working days (however, this is dependent on Companies House workload and may take longer).</li>
