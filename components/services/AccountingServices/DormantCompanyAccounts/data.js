        <li>Address (This will be shown on the share certificate)</li>
        <li>The total amount of shares being transferred</li>

        <li>5-6 shareholders: £89.99</li>

    content: `<p>
    Stamp duty is usually only applicable if the value of shares being transferred is over £1,000. </br>
Shares worth more than £1,000 will incur a tax/duty of 0.5%. This is then rounded up to the nearest £5.</br>
For example, when you purchase shares worth £1,010, you’ll need to pay 0.5% on that total, which is £5.05. This is then rounded up to £10 - so £10 is payable in stamp duty.</br>
Stamp duty should be paid within 30 days of the transfer taking place.

    content: `It’s up to you. The purpose of a confirmation statement is to ensure Companies House hold accurate and up-to-date information for a company. Companies House are only notified of a company’s new shareholding situation when a confirmation statement is filed. Whilst not compulsory, many business owners wish for Companies House to be notified as soon as they have transferred shares - this is often because of a request from the bank.
