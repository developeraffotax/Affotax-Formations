Your residential address will be visible to your customers, vendors, clients, other third parties and the general public.

        If you're running a business in the UK, you'll need a registered business address. This address will be listed on your company's website and other marketing materials, and it’s where clients and customers will send correspondence. You can use a residential address for your business, but there are a few things to keep in mind:

        <li>Full Name.</li>
        <li>Date of Birth.</li>
        <li>Occupation.</li>
        <li>Nationality.</li>
        <li>Residential Address.</li>
        <li>Service Address (residential or other address).</li>
        <li>Appointment Date.</li>
        
        If you decide to use a residential address for your business, ensure you're aware of the potential drawbacks.
