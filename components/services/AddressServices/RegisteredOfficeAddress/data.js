        If you're running a business in the UK, you'll need a registered business address. This address will be listed on your company's website and other marketing materials, and it’s where clients and customers will send correspondence. You can use a residential address for your business, but there are a few things to keep in mind:

        <li>Using a residential address may give the impression that your business is small or unprofessional.</li>
        <li>You may start to receive a lot of junk mail at your home address if you use it for your business.</li>
        <li>Your local council may charge you extra if you use a residential address for business purposes.</li>
        
        If you decide to use a residential address for your business, ensure you're aware of the potential drawbacks.
