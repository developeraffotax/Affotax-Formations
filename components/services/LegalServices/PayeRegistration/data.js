    content: `<p> Pay As You Earn (PAYE) is an HMRC system that employers use to calculate and deduct Income Tax, National Insurance Contributions (NIC), student loan repayments, pension contributions, child maintenance, and other relevant payments from employees’ salaries or wages before they receive them.</p>
   <p>Most employers need to operate PAYE through their payroll software and report their employees’ payments and deductions to HMRC each payday. Employer’s National Insurance is also calculated and paid through PAYE. </p>

    content: `<ul class="">

        You only need to register your company for PAYE if any employees (including directors) meet at least one of the following conditions:

        <li>Are paid £120 or more per week (2021-22 tax year)</li>
        <li>Receive a pension</li>
        <li>Have a second job</li>
        <li>Receive expenses or other employee benefits</li>
        
        Additionally, you must register for PAYE if you operate under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) as a contractor.
        </ul>`,

    header: `Do I need to register for PAYE if I do not have any employees?`,
    content: `You may still have to register for PAYE even if you do not have any employees. PAYE registration will depend on whether you (or any other directors) take a director’s salary of £120 or more per week and/or receive employee expenses or benefits through the company, and/or whether the company pays subcontractors to do construction work.`,

    content: `<ul class="">

        You will have to register your company as an employer with HMRC if you employ staff (this includes directors) or use subcontractors for construction work, but only if the company:

        <li>pays any of its employees or directors £120 or more per week (Lower Earnings Limit for National Insurance contributions)</li>
        <li>employs someone who receives a pension or has a second job</li>
        <li>provides expenses and/or benefits to any employees or directors</li>
        <li>uses subcontractors under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)</li>
        
However, if none of these conditions are met, you do not have to register as an employer or set up PAYE, but you must still keep payroll records of what employees and directors are paid.
